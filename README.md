Respa-Exchange
==============

A connector for bidirectional synchronization of [Respa][respa]
event information with Microsoft Exchange resource calendars.

Development/howto
-----------------

* Install requirements, etc.
* Copy `respa-exchange.cfg.example` to `respa-exchange.cfg`;
  change the parameters to match your authentication details.
* Run `test2.py`.  This will obviously change once the project
  is more than a POC.

Requirements
------------

* Microsoft Exchange On-Premises installation with
  Exchange Web Services enabled
